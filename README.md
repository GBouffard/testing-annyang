# :microphone: Testing Annyang :microphone:

I learnt about Annyang at a conference so made a small repo with `create-react-app` to try it.
It works! It's awesome.

## How to run it:

```
git clone git@github.com/GBouffard/testing-annyang
cd testing-annyang
npm install
npm start
```

## Github Pages Link:

[Guillaume's Testing Annyang](https://gbouffard.github.io/testing-annyang/)
You will need to allow the ap to access your microphone for it to work.
